# TenantGuard

TenantGuard is a CLI-first SaaS Build Kernel for teams building multi-tenant SaaS systems with GitHub, specs, CI, and AI coding agents.

It helps teams answer:

- What is the current source truth?
- What is risky?
- What is blocked?
- What is the next safest task?
- What files may an AI agent touch?
- Is this PR ready to merge?

TenantGuard is not a SaaS boilerplate. It does not generate a full app. It controls the build process around architecture, gates, queues, prompts, and verification.

## Status

TenantGuard's MVP CLI chain is implemented and in release-readiness hardening. The current focus is a reliable first-run demo, documented command surface, and launch prerequisites.

GitHub App, hosted dashboard, auto-fix, auto-commit, and auto-merge remain deferred.

## Quickstart

From a fresh checkout:

```bash
pnpm install
pwsh -File scripts/smoke-first-run.ps1
```

The smoke script copies `examples/multi-tenant-saas-basic` into a temporary git repo, runs the MVP CLI chain, creates a controlled local diff, and verifies the expected outputs.

Manual command shape while the CLI is still TypeScript-source-first:

```bash
pnpm dlx tsx packages/cli/src/bin.ts scan <repo> --out <out-dir>
pnpm dlx tsx packages/cli/src/bin.ts gates <repo> --out <out-dir>
pnpm dlx tsx packages/cli/src/bin.ts queue <repo> --out <out-dir>
pnpm dlx tsx packages/cli/src/bin.ts route <repo> --out <out-dir>
pnpm dlx tsx packages/cli/src/bin.ts prompt Q-001 --agent claude --out <out-dir>
pnpm dlx tsx packages/cli/src/bin.ts review-pr <repo> --local-diff --out <out-dir>
```

## Core flow

```text
scan sources
→ build project map
→ run gates
→ derive queue
→ route next safest task
→ compile agent prompt
→ review result/PR
```

## MVP Commands

```bash
tenantguard scan [path]
tenantguard map
tenantguard gates [path]
tenantguard queue [path]
tenantguard route [path]
tenantguard prompt <id> --agent claude|codex|generic
tenantguard review-pr [path] --local-diff
tenantguard review-pr <number>
```

The npm-published `tenantguard` binary is a follow-up release task. Until then, local and CI usage runs the TypeScript CLI through `tsx`.
