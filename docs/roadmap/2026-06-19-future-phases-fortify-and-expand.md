# TenantGuard Future Phases — Fortify, then Expand

Status: Brainstormed design, pending review
Date: 2026-06-19
Scope: The roadmap layer **after** public launch. The near-term waves A–F
(`docs/roadmap/post-foundation-technical-plan.md`: contracts → config → npm →
Action → launch) are already settled. This document covers what comes next.

## Executive decision

After launch, TenantGuard's single biggest risk is **not believed findings**.
Its entire value rests on `risks.json` being trusted. So the future roadmap is
ordered fortify-first, then expand:

```text
FORTIFY                                    EXPAND
─────────────────────────────────────     ──────────────────────────────────
P1  Deepen detection (credible findings)   P4  GitHub App (reach, report-only)
P2  Calibrate (false-positive control)  →  P5  Multi-repo / org view
P3  Prove it (eval harness + benchmark)    P6  Enforcing CI check (opt-in)
```

The ordering is a **dependency chain, not a preference**:

```text
P1 deepen detection  ──┐
P2 calibrate (tiers)  ──┼──► P3 prove ──► P4 GitHub App ──► P5 org view ──► P6 enforce
                        │     (precision/  (reach)          (aggregate)     (block confirmed,
   evidence ──► tiers ──┘      recall                                        override + audit)
                               per tier)
```

You cannot prove (P3) what isn't calibrated (P2); you cannot aggregate
trustworthily (P5) without versioned + tiered output; and you **must not**
enforce (P6) findings whose precision you have not measured (P3).

## Identity decision (locked)

TenantGuard stays the **control plane, not an actor**. It scans, judges,
routes, and advises. It never runs agents, never mutates code, never
auto-commits, never auto-merges. Expansion grows *reach* (more eyes on the same
advisory output), never *hands on code*.

Explicitly rejected: a supervised "apply loop" that runs agents and proposes
fixes. That would break the trust model and the constitution
(`CLAUDE.md`: "Do not execute AI agents from the product in MVP",
"Do not store or print secrets", "no hidden mutation").

The strongest form this roadmap reaches is P6 — *binding advice* (block a merge
on proven findings, always overridable by a human with an audited reason). That
is advice with teeth, not an actor.

## FORTIFY

### Phase P1 — Deepen detection

**Problem.** Three detectors (`repos`, `secrets`, `stack` in
`packages/scanner/src/detect/`) feed ten gates (G0–G9). Gates like G4
(Security/Tenant Isolation), G3 (Migration Safety), and G5 (Idempotency) reason
about evidence the scanner barely collects. A gate is only as smart as its
inputs.

**Add — new read-only evidence detectors** that produce the structural evidence
the existing gates are starving for:

| Detector | Feeds | Evidence it collects |
|---|---|---|
| `routes` | G2, G4 | API endpoints, handlers, which routes touch tenant-scoped data |
| `data-access` | G4, G5 | DB query sites, ORM calls, presence/absence of tenant-id filters |
| `migrations` | G3 | migration files, destructive ops (DROP/ALTER), reversibility |
| `auth` | G4 | auth middleware, RBAC checks, unprotected handlers |
| `config-surface` | G6, G7 | env var usage, billing/usage hooks, log/metric emission points |

**Design principle.** Every detector stays **read-only and evidence-emitting**:
it adds fields to the project map; it never judges. Judgment stays in the gates.
A detector must not import gate logic. Each is its own file (~200 lines, one
responsibility) matching the existing `repos.ts` / `secrets.ts` / `stack.ts`
pattern — no new architecture, more of the proven one.

**Testability.** Given a fixture repo, assert the emitted evidence. Each
detector is independently testable.

### Phase P2 — Calibrate (false-positive control)

**Problem.** More detectors (P1) means more findings, means more chances to be
wrong. A security tool that cries wolf gets muted. This is where the #1
adoption threat (false positives → abandonment) lives. P1 makes findings
*deeper*; P2 makes them *believed*.

**Add — a confidence and evidence model on every finding:**

- **Confidence tiers per finding:** `confirmed` (structural evidence — e.g. a DB
  query with no tenant filter on a known tenant-scoped table) vs `suspected`
  (heuristic — e.g. a route name that *looks* admin-ish). Each finding carries a
  tier and the **evidence span** (`file:line` + the matched signal) that
  justifies it. No finding without a pointer to why.
- **Severity × confidence routing:** the queue/router sorts by *both*. A
  `confirmed/critical` G4 routes ahead of a `suspected/high`. Low-confidence
  findings are reported but never block.
- **Tunable thresholds via config:** extends the 013 config boundary so a repo
  can set "only surface `confirmed` findings for G7" — without silently
  suppressing anything. Suppressions stay audited and expiring (Wave D model).

**Why P2 before P3.** You cannot benchmark a finding engine with no notion of
confidence — the eval harness must measure precision/recall *per tier*.
"We catch 90% of real leaks at `confirmed`" is a provable claim; "we emit a lot
of findings" is not.

The confidence tier is the lever that lets the *same* engine serve both audit
mode ("show me everything") and CI mode ("block only what's certain" — exactly
what P6 needs).

### Phase P3 — Prove it (eval harness + benchmark)

**Problem.** After P1–P2, findings *look* credible. "Looks credible" ≠ "is
correct." Without measurement, every claim is an opinion, and any future
detector change can silently degrade quality.

**Add — a benchmark corpus + an eval harness:**

- **Labeled corpus** (`benchmark/cases/`): small self-contained fixture repos,
  each with ground truth — `expected.json` listing findings that *should* fire
  (true positives) plus clean variants that should fire *nothing* (true
  negatives). Cases drawn from real multi-tenant failure patterns: missing
  tenant filter, destructive migration, unprotected admin route, non-idempotent
  webhook, leaked secret. **Synthetic only — no Retail Tower / ERPNext private
  logic** (constitution hard rule).
- **Eval harness** (`packages/eval` or a `benchmark/` runner): runs
  `scan → gates` over each case, diffs actual findings vs `expected.json`,
  computes **precision / recall per confidence tier**. (This is why P2 came
  first — the metric is tier-aware.)
- **Scorecard artifact** (`benchmark-report.json` + markdown): the provable
  claim, versioned like every other output. "At `confirmed` tier: G4 recall
  0.92, precision 0.97." Doubles as launch evidence and a dogfood CI regression
  gate.
- **Regression detection** (`benchmark/thresholds.json`): if a PR drops recall
  below a floor or raises false positives above a ceiling, dogfood CI flags it.
  The tool's own quality is gated by the discipline it sells.

**Boundary discipline.** The harness is a separate package/dir that consumes
public `scan` / `gates` outputs only — never reaches into detector internals.
That keeps it honest (tests the contract, not the implementation) and doubles
as the external "does TenantGuard work on my repo?" proof.

This is eval-driven development applied to a static analyzer: the corpus is the
test suite, but assertions are *statistical* (precision/recall), because a
detector that catches 19/20 leaks is shippable while a unit test failing 1/20 is
broken.

## EXPAND

Each expand phase grows reach over the now-proven advisory output. None of them
touch code.

### Phase P4 — GitHub App (report-only)

**Problem.** The value chain lives in a terminal + dogfood CI. To enter a
team's daily habit, findings must appear *where review happens* — on the PR.
The constitution parks the GitHub App; P4 is when it is safe to build, because
findings are now deep (P1), calibrated (P2), and proven (P3).

**Add:**

- A **report-only GitHub App**: installs on a repo, runs the existing
  `review-pr` chain per PR, posts findings as a **Checks run + inline PR
  annotations** (`file:line` from P2 evidence spans pay off directly here).
- **Constitution wall preserved:** no commits, no pushes, no auto-merge, no
  auto-fix, no agent execution. It comments and sets a check *status*; the human
  decides. This is the existing dogfood Action behavior, productized as an
  installable App.
- **Confidence tiers drive presentation:** `confirmed` findings render as
  failed/neutral checks with detail; `suspected` render as collapsed advisory
  notes — so the PR is not flooded.
- **Stateless by default:** computes from source truth per-PR; no database, no
  stored code. Keeps the secrets/data posture clean and defers the hosted-data
  question until P5 actually needs it.

### Phase P5 — Multi-repo / org view

**Problem.** P4 puts findings on one PR in one repo. The buyer for a
build-control kernel is the eng lead / platform team who owns *many* SaaS repos
and needs org-level answers: which repos have unresolved `confirmed` G4 leaks?
Which teams are accumulating migration risk? Is tenant-isolation posture
improving or drifting? No single-repo surface answers that.

**Add — aggregation over already-produced advisory artifacts (not new
judgment):**

- **Roll-up layer** that ingests per-repo `report.json` / `risks.json`
  (versioned outputs) and aggregates by repo × gate × confidence × age.
- **Trend tracking:** because every output is versioned and timestamped, P5
  shows *direction* — "G4 `confirmed` findings down 40% this quarter." The
  metric an eng leader renews for.
- **Read-only dashboard** (the parked "hosted dashboard," now justified):
  visualizes aggregated artifacts. **Stores findings metadata, never source
  code** — the App stays stateless (P4); the dashboard stores only the JSON
  reports teams choose to publish to it.
- **Identity boundary:** the dashboard *displays*; it never re-judges or
  mutates. All judgment stays in the CLI/gates engine. The dashboard is a lens —
  consistent with "control plane, not actor."

P5 is where versioned contracts (Wave C) and confidence tiers (P2) compound:
aggregation is trustworthy only if the JSON shape is stable across repos and
time, and trend lines are meaningful only if `confirmed` is tracked separately
from `suspected`. This is why the dashboard was correctly deferred — building it
before the contracts froze would mean rebuilding it after every schema drift.

### Phase P6 — Enforcing CI check (opt-in, much later)

**Problem & danger.** Everything so far is advisory — a team can ignore
findings. The natural mature-buyer ask is "make this a required check that
blocks a merge." This is the one phase touching the constitution's edge, so it
is deliberately last and opt-in.

**Add — with rails that keep it constitution-safe:**

- **Opt-in enforcement only:** a repo explicitly sets a policy ("block merge on
  any unresolved `confirmed` G4"). Default stays report-only forever. No repo is
  blocked without opting in.
- **Only `confirmed` findings can block** — never `suspected`. This is the
  reason P2's tiers and P3's proven precision are hard preconditions: you may
  only block on findings whose precision you have *measured* (e.g. "G4
  `confirmed` precision ≥ 0.97 on the benchmark"). Blocking on un-proven
  findings destroys trust on the first false positive.
- **Mandatory override + audit trail:** every block is overridable by a human
  with a recorded reason and expiry (reusing the audited-suppressions model from
  Wave D). The tool never has the final, unappealable say — it sets a gate, a
  human can open it, the override is logged.
- **Still no agent execution, no auto-fix, no auto-merge** — the wall holds. P6
  is the strongest form of *advice*, not an *actor*.

## Priority order

1. P1 — deepen detection (new read-only detectors).
2. P2 — calibrate (confidence tiers + evidence spans).
3. P3 — prove it (eval harness + benchmark corpus + regression thresholds).
4. P4 — GitHub App (report-only, on the PR).
5. P5 — multi-repo / org view (aggregate + trend, read-only dashboard).
6. P6 — enforcing CI check (opt-in, blocks `confirmed` only, override + audit).

## Hard non-goals (unchanged from the constitution)

```text
No running AI agents from the product.
No auto-fix, auto-commit, auto-merge.
No hidden mutation.
No storing or printing secrets.
No storing source code in any hosted surface (metadata/reports only, P5).
No Retail Tower private domain rules.
No ERPNext-specific rules.
No broad rewrites.
```

## The single next action

When this roadmap is approved, the first implementable slice is **P1** — and the
first detector to add is the one that most directly unstarves the highest-value
gate. Recommendation: start with `data-access` (feeds G4 tenant-isolation, the
product's headline promise). Each detector ships as its own reviewed spec → plan
→ tasks cycle, per the constitution's implementation boundary.
