# Implementation Plan: Derived Queue & Router

**Branch**: `005-derived-queue-router` | **Date**: 2026-06-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-derived-queue-router/spec.md`

## Summary

Turn evidence into action. A new package `packages/queue` **derives `queue.json`** — safe, scoped work
items — from the Project Map (002) and gate findings (004, `risks.json`), then **routes** to exactly
one next-safest task (`route.json`, also printed) with an explicit reason and a blocked list. v0 is
deterministic, read-only, local-first, secret-free, and domain-neutral. Exposed via `tenantguard queue`
and `tenantguard route`.

**Technical approach** (decided at this plan layer):

1. **Scoring = a transparent weighted-sum over the spec's named factors** (readiness, risk, blast
   radius, dependency status, validation availability, scope clarity, lock overlap, doc freshness),
   resolving the spec's deferred formula. Recorded as **ADR-004** (a 005 task, mirroring ADR-002/003).
   The **selection ordering is already pinned by the spec**: primary sort `score desc`, ties broken by
   `blast_radius asc` → `risk asc` → `id asc`. See Research R1.
2. **Package boundary**: new `packages/queue` consumes a written `risks.json` (validated via
   `@tenantguard/gates` `risksSchema`) + `project-map.json` (validated via `@tenantguard/project-map`),
   and reuses `@tenantguard/scanner`'s read-only `io.ts` for optional diff/PR evidence + output writes.
   It **imports `evidenceSchema` from `@tenantguard/project-map`** for queue-item `source.evidence`
   (never redefined, FR-003). See Research R2.
3. **Schema home**: the `queueItemSchema` / `queueSchema` / `routeDecisionSchema` (Zod) live in
   `packages/queue`. See Research R3.

**No production code is created by this plan.** Implementation begins only after `plan.md` + `tasks.md`
are reviewed (AC-009; constitution §Development Workflow).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript on Node.js LTS (per ADR-001).
**Primary Dependencies**: `@tenantguard/project-map` (map contract + `evidenceSchema` + `validate`);
  `@tenantguard/gates` (`risksSchema` + `Finding` types — the queue's evidence source);
  `@tenantguard/scanner` (read-only `io.ts`, optional diff via git read); **Commander** (CLI, ADR-002);
  **Zod** (queue/route schemas). No network client.
**Storage**: Reads `project-map.json` + `risks.json` from the out-dir; optionally reads the local diff
  (read-only). Writes `queue.json` + `route.json` to the **designated out-dir outside tracked source**
  (default `./.tenantguard/`, FR-016) — never mutates scanned files.
**Testing**: Vitest. Fixtures = a synthetic map+risks pair producing a mixed-readiness queue (ready,
  blocked-by-dep, blocked-by-lock-overlap, circular-dep), reusing the 003/004 fixture-prep helper
  pattern where a real repo is needed.
**Target Platform**: Local dev machine / CI runner; Node CLI. No network.
**Project Type**: CLI tool + supporting library (monorepo packages).
**Performance Goals**: Derive + route over a typical repo's findings in well under a second; no hard
  throughput target for MVP.
**Constraints**: Deterministic (FR-009, SC-005); read-only incl. optional diff (FR-011); no
  network/credentials (FR-011, SC-007); no secrets (FR-012, SC-007); domain-neutral (FR-013); every
  finding-derived item traces to evidence (FR-003, SC-002); circular deps detected (FR-010, SC-006).
**Scale/Scope**: Single-task-by-default routing; one derived queue per run; no cross-run persistence
  (Non-Goal).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0. Re-check after Phase 1.* Against the 8 named principles.

| Principle | Relevance | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| I. Source Truth First | Queue/route derive only from current map + findings (+ optional diff); "no safe task" is explicit, never an arbitrary pick (FR-007). | ✅ Pass |
| II. CLI First | Delivered as `tenantguard queue` / `route`; local, no network/credentials (FR-011). | ✅ Pass |
| III. Evidence-Based | Every finding-derived item traces to its source evidence; reasons cite why (FR-003, FR-005, SC-002). | ✅ Pass |
| IV. Spec-Compatible | Operates on any scanned repo's map + risks; no methodology requirement. | ✅ Pass |
| V. Agent Safety | Queue items carry scope, allowed/forbidden files, gates, validation, stop conditions — the raw material 006 compiles into safe prompts. | ✅ Pass |
| VI. No Hidden Mutation | **Read-only** on the scanned repo incl. optional diff; output only to the out-dir; no execute/commit/merge (Non-Goals). | ✅ Pass |
| VII. No Secrets | Queue items + router output never contain secrets (FR-012, SC-007); inherits 002/004 secret-safe evidence. | ✅ Pass |
| VIII. Clean Extraction | Generalized routing rules only — no Retail Tower / ERPNext / POS specifics (FR-013). | ✅ Pass |

**No gate violations — no Complexity Tracking entries required.** Docs-first: this plan creates no
code; implementation waits on reviewed `plan.md` + `tasks.md`.

```

**Structure Decision**: A new `packages/queue` library (pure derivation + scoring + routing + schemas)
plus thin new commands in the **existing** `packages/cli`. `packages/queue` depends on
`@tenantguard/project-map`, `@tenantguard/gates`, and `@tenantguard/scanner`, keeping the read-only
guarantee centralized and letting 006 (prompt compiler) consume queue items + the router decision
directly. This plan **does not create** any of the above; the split is confirmable at `/speckit-tasks`.
