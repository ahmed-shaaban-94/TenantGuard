# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub Action

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No prescribed implementation details — CI runtime/packaging/YAML deferred to implementation
- [x] Focused on automatic per-PR TenantGuard feedback (core value)
- [~] Written for stakeholders — readable, but CI/developer tooling; some terms inherent (caveat)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (empty diff, TenantGuard error, secrets, limited permissions)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (CI summary + optional blocking; NO workflow file created here)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (depends on 001/003/004/007)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (PR summary, critical-gate blocking)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (beyond the deferral note)

## Notes

- CRITICAL scope point: this is a docs-only spec; per repo CLAUDE.md it does NOT create any
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` file. The workflow YAML is implementation, separately gated.
- The Action reuses the existing CLI (scan→gates→review), not a separate engine.
- Read-only + no-stored-tokens + no PR comments/labels (those are deferred GitHub App territory).
