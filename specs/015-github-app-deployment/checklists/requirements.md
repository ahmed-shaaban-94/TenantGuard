# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub App Deployment Runtime

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Two decisions locked up front (owner-approved): credentials are environment/secret-manager only and never persisted (Principle VII), and v1 targets a self-hostable single-tenant Node service. Recorded in Clarifications.
- Secret handling (FR-005–FR-007, US2, SC-003) is the constitution-critical surface — this is the first TenantGuard feature touching live credentials.
- Deferred to plan: GitHub auth mechanism specifics, observability/logging design, concurrency implementation. None blocks the spec; all noted as assumptions.
- Scope walls off P5 (dashboard) and P6 (enforcing check); this feature is runtime completion of P4 only.
