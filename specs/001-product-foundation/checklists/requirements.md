# Specification Quality Checklist: Product Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No prescribed implementation details — stack named only as an explicit *deferral* in
      Assumptions ("the blueprint proposes ..."), never as a binding requirement (see AC-009)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [~] Written for stakeholders — readable, but this is developer tooling; some domain jargon
      (TG-G gates, idempotency, tenant isolation) is inherent and unavoidable (pass with caveat)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Tech-stack neutrality is enforced: the spec states product constraints (CLI-first, local-first,
  no secrets) but defers language/runtime/test-framework to `plan.md` and the tech ADR. The single
  mention of TypeScript/Node/pnpm/Vitest/Zod is confined to the Assumptions section as a *deferral
  note* ("the blueprint proposes ..."), not as a binding requirement — this keeps the requirements
  and success criteria technology-agnostic per AC-009.
- This is a product-foundation document; the Spec Kit template's app-feature sections (User Stories,
  Acceptance Scenarios, Key Entities) are kept and reframed for TenantGuard's actual users (teams)
  and system (the CLI). Additional product sections (purpose, non-goals, workflow, principles,
  follow-up specs) are added per the feature request.
