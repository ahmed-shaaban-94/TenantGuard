# Feature Specification: SaaS Gates v0

**Feature Branch**: `004-saas-gates-v0`
**Created**: 2026-06-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement initial SaaS gate checks with evidence-based findings. Depends on 001, 002, 003. Docs only; no production code."

**Depends on**: `001-product-foundation`, `002-project-map-schema`, `003-cli-scanner`
**Blocks**: `005-derived-queue-router` (router consumes gate findings), `007-pr-reviewer` (review runs gates)

---

## Purpose *(mandatory)*

SaaS Gates v0 are TenantGuard's risk-detection layer. They read the Project Map (002) and the repo's
current evidence and produce a `risks.json` — a list of evidence-backed findings tied to named gates
(TG-G0…TG-G9). Gates are the same checks TenantGuard applies to user projects and to its own PRs.

This spec defines the **gate model and the v0 check set** (what each gate looks for, what evidence it
must cite, how findings are shaped), not the parsing internals or rule-engine library.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

"User" is a developer/team running gates over a scanned repo.

### User Story 1 - Get an evidence-backed risk list (Priority: P1)

A developer runs the gates over a scanned repo and gets `risks.json` where every finding names a gate,
a severity, and concrete evidence.

**Why this priority**: Risk findings are the raw material for routing, prompts, and PR review. Without
evidence-backed findings, the rest of the product has nothing trustworthy to act on.

**Independent Test**: Run gates over a repo with a known violation (e.g. an API route without an auth
guard) and confirm a finding appears, tied to the right gate, with evidence pointing at the file.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a scanned repo, **When** gates run, **Then** a `risks.json` is produced.
2. **Given** any finding, **When** inspected, **Then** it cites a gate id, a severity, and at least
   one piece of concrete evidence (file/line/changed-file/missing-artifact/failed-command).
3. **Given** a clean repo for a given gate, **When** that gate runs, **Then** it produces no
   false-positive finding for that gate.

### User Story 2 - Understand and prioritize risks (Priority: P2)

A team lead reviews `risks.json` and can tell, per finding, which gate it belongs to, how severe it is,
and where to look.

**Why this priority**: Findings must be actionable; severity + location is what makes triage possible.

**Independent Test**: Produce a risk list spanning several gates and confirm each finding is
classifiable by gate and severity without reading code.

### User Story 3 - Run a subset of gates (Priority: P3)

A developer runs only the gates relevant to a change (e.g. security + idempotency) and gets just those
findings.

**Why this priority**: Targeted runs keep feedback fast and relevant, especially for PR review (007).

---

### Edge Cases

- **Insufficient evidence for a gate**: the gate reports "needs verification" rather than asserting
  pass or fail.
- **Gate not applicable** (e.g. no billing surface): the gate is skipped/marked not-applicable, not
  failed.
- **Empty / non-SaaS repo**: gates produce an empty or minimal risk list, no fabricated findings.
- **Conflicting evidence**: finding is emitted at lower confidence rather than as a hard assertion.
- **Secret-like content found by a gate**: flagged as a finding; the secret value itself is never
  copied into the risk list.

---

## Gate Model *(mandatory)*

Each gate has: a stable **id** (TG-Gn), a **name**, a **purpose** (what risk it detects), the
**evidence** it relies on, and **example signals** it looks for. v0 gates:

### TG-G0 — Source Truth Gate
No routing, prompt, or readiness claim before source evidence is read. Evidence: repo files,
`git status`, local diff, PR metadata, CI status, spec files.

### TG-G1 — Architecture Boundary Gate
Detects boundary violations. Signals: frontend importing backend internals; worker exposing public
HTTP routes; direct DB access from UI; an integration adapter bypassing the API boundary.

### TG-G2 — Contract/API Gate
Detects API contract drift. Signals: route changed without OpenAPI update; OpenAPI changed without
generated-client update; public response shape changed without tests.

### TG-G3 — Migration Safety Gate
Detects risky DB changes. Signals: destructive migration; dropped column/table; non-null column
without default; migration without rollback note; migration without test/seed consideration.

### TG-G4 — Security/Tenant Isolation Gate
Detects missing/risky tenant boundaries. Signals: API route without auth guard; query without tenant
filter; admin route without role guard; `tenant_id` missing from a new table; secrets printed in logs.

### TG-G5 — Idempotency Gate
Detects mutation flows that can duplicate work. Signals: webhook handler without
signature/idempotency tracking; background job without idempotency key; payment action without replay
protection; external posting call without dedupe key.

### TG-G6 — Billing/Usage Gate
Detects billing-sensitive issues. Signals: usage event without tenant/account id; plan-limit bypass;
unmetered expensive operation; pricing config changed without tests.

### TG-G7 — Observability Gate
Detects missing operational signals. Signals: critical mutation without audit event; job without
structured logs; external integration without correlation id; missing retry/dead-letter path.

### TG-G8 — Dependency/Upgrade Gate
Detects dependency risks. Signals: lockfile changed unexpectedly; major upgrade without notes; CI
version mismatch; runtime version drift.

### TG-G9 — Release Readiness Gate
Detects release blockers. Signals: critical gates failing; CI failing; no rollback note for a risky
change; unresolved high-risk review finding.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST define the v0 gate set (TG-G0…TG-G9), each with id, name, purpose, and
  the evidence it relies on.
- **FR-002**: Running gates over a scanned repo MUST produce a `risks.json` list of findings.
- **FR-003**: Every finding MUST cite a gate id, a severity, and at least one piece of concrete
  evidence; findings without evidence MUST NOT be emitted.
- **FR-004**: A gate with insufficient evidence MUST report "needs verification," never a fabricated
  pass/fail.
- **FR-005**: A gate that does not apply to a repo MUST be marked not-applicable/skipped, not failed.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST support running a subset of gates.
- **FR-007**: Gate runs MUST be deterministic for unchanged input (stable findings and ordering).
- **FR-008**: Gates MUST read the Project Map (002) and repo evidence; they MUST be read-only on the
  scanned repo.
- **FR-009**: Findings MUST NOT contain secrets; secret-like content MUST be flagged, never copied.
- **FR-010**: Gates MUST run with no network access and no credentials (local-first).
- **FR-011**: Gates MUST be domain-neutral — generalized SaaS rules, no Retail Tower/ERPNext/POS
  specifics.

### Key Entities

- **Gate**: a named check (id, name, purpose, evidence basis).
- **Finding**: one detected risk (gate id, severity, location, evidence, confidence).
- **Risk List** (`risks.json`): the collection of findings from a gate run.
- **Severity**: a classification (e.g. low/medium/high/critical) supporting triage.

## CLI Surface *(mandatory)*

```text
tenantguard gates       run the gate set (or a subset) over the scanned repo, produce risks.json
```

---

## Required Outputs *(mandatory)*

```text
risks.json   evidence-backed findings (gate id, severity, location, evidence, confidence)
```

---

## Non-Goals *(mandatory)*

```text
- Auto-fixing any finding.
- Deriving a queue or routing from findings (that is 005).
- Compiling prompts (006) or reviewing PRs (007).
- A full static-analysis / data-flow engine — v0 is signal-based, evidence-first detection.
- An OPA/Rego policy engine (deferred).
- Choosing a rule-engine library or language (decided at plan layer).
- Retail Tower / ERPNext / POS-specific gate rules.
```

---

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Running gates over a repo with a known violation produces a finding tied to the correct
  gate with evidence pointing at the offending location.
- **SC-002**: 100% of emitted findings cite a gate id, severity, and at least one evidence item.
- **SC-003**: A repo clean for a gate produces 0 false-positive findings for that gate (on the v0
  sample set).
- **SC-004**: A gate with insufficient evidence reports "needs verification" rather than pass/fail.
- **SC-005**: Two gate runs over unchanged input produce equivalent risk lists (deterministic).
- **SC-006**: 0 secrets appear in any risk list.
- **SC-007**: Gates run with no network access and no credentials.

---

## Acceptance Criteria for This Feature *(mandatory)*

- **AC-001**: The v0 gate set (TG-G0…TG-G9) is defined with id, name, purpose, and evidence basis.
- **AC-002**: Finding shape (gate id, severity, location, evidence, confidence) is specified.
- **AC-003**: "Needs verification" and "not applicable" behaviors are specified.
- **AC-004**: Subset execution and determinism are specified.
- **AC-005**: Read-only, local-first, no-secrets, domain-neutral guarantees are specified.
- **AC-006**: CLI surface (`gates`) and required output (`risks.json`) are defined.
- **AC-007**: Non-goals are explicit (auto-fix, queue, prompts, review, full SA, OPA, library choice).
- **AC-008**: The spec is implementation-neutral on the rule engine (deferred to plan).
- **AC-009**: No production code, gate code, `package.json`, or lockfile is created.

---

## Assumptions

- **Rule-engine approach deferred** to plan/ADR. The blueprint proposes TypeScript rules + YAML config
  for v0, with OPA/Rego deferred; this spec mandates the gate *model and behavior*, not the engine.
- **Severity scale** is a small ordered set (e.g. low/medium/high/critical); the exact labels are
  refined at plan layer.
- **v0 detection is signal-based**, not exhaustive static analysis — false negatives are acceptable in
  v0 as long as findings that ARE emitted are evidence-backed and low on false positives.
- **Gate vocabulary** (surface names, boundary rule keys) aligns with the 002 schema and 003 scanner
  output; where they differ, the schema is authoritative.
- **PR/diff evidence** (for gates like TG-G2/G3/G8) is available when reviewing changes; full coverage
  of diff-only gates matures alongside 007-pr-reviewer.
